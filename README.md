# Daily word guessing game in Japanese (Wordle clone)

This is an adaptation of Josh Wardle's original game, Wordle, into Japanese. Forked and modified from gugray's version in Hungarian.

### Japanese adaptation and motivation

This game uses romaji instead of kana.

I considered making a hiragana version, but I thought that maybe it would be hard to find a balance between number of kana, word length and tries. That's why I made a romaji version.

I wanted to make this game in order to both get experience with HTML/Node.js and learn new Japanese vocabulary.
